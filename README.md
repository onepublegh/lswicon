# lswicon
LEGO Star Wars Icon Generator

# How to use
Download the latest release here https://github.com/onepublegh/lswicon/releases/latest
Make sure to download both the .exe and .pck files

Import an image that you want to be in the icon and change the settings to your liking.
When using the original icon texture, it is recommended that you import low res images
as scaling a high res image down to 128x looks aliased and bad.

# How to build source code
Download Godot Game Engine from https://godotengine.org/ and export for whatever platform you want.
